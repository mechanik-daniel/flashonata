It is not to be used to record Care Teams, these should be in a CareTeam resource that may be linked to the CarePlan or EpisodeOfCare resources.\nMultiple GPs may be recorded against the patient for various reasons, such as a student that has his home GP listed along with the GP at university during the school semesters, or a \"fly-in/fly-out\" worker that has the onsite GP also included with his home GP to remain aware of medical issues.\n\nJurisdictions may decide that they can profile this down to 1 if desired, or 1 per type.",
